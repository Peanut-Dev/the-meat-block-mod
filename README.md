### About

***

The Meat Block Mod adds 3 new blocks: the Raw Meat Block, the Spoiled Meat Block and the Cooked Meat Block.

***

**Raw Meat Block:**

A slimy edible block that can be used in redstone with functionality similar the to Honey and Slime blocks.   
Don't leave it out too long, or it will spoil!   


***

**Spoiled Meat Block:**

When placed it is functionally identical to the Raw Meat Block, but you probably don't want to touch it.   
Once spoiled it cannot be cooked.

***

**Cooked Meat Block:**

This is what happens when you cook a Raw Meat Block, and it's much better for you.   
Can also be placed, but does not behave similarly to the raw and spoiled meat blocks.
